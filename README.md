Based on: https://github.com/m5stack/M5Paper_FactoryTest

# About
There is a project called https://github.com/tsndr/M5PaperOS which aimed at creating an OS out of the M5 Paper demo code. Unfortunately it is a bit broken and out of date.

My aim with this project is to create more apps in the M5Paper_FactoryTest and also make it a bit more user friendly along the way
